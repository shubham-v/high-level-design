Storage
Video:
 2160p:
  FPS: 24
  Audio:
  Size of 1 min video: 300MB
  Size of 60 mins video = 300MB * 60 min = 18000MB = 18GB ~= 20GB
 Total size for 100K videos = 100K * 20 = 2 PB 
 Total size for all formats: 2PB * 2 = 4 PB 
 Replication over 10 regions = 4PB * 10 = 40PB 
 Video files in Blob Store like S3


Bandwidth Estimations:
Video Read/Stream
10M users at peak
Per hour bandwith for 1 user 20GB/hr = 5.6 MB/sec
Per hour bandwidth 10 million users: 10M * 20GB/hr = 20PB/hr = 5.6 TB/sec
Use Content Delivery Network with multiple Point of Presence
Caching at Internet Exchange Point




Video processing
1000 videos a day
1hr length
20GB * 1000 = 20TB/day
For all resolutions = 20TB * 2 = 40TB/day
40TB/864000sec = 463 MB/sec


Read   +   Process  + Write
(10ms  +   20ms       + 20ms) = 50ms/MB


Work To done = 463mb * (50 * 10^-3)sec = 23.1sec/sec






User Metadata:
User watches 10K videos in lifetime


Watched
user_id, video_id, video_offset, created_at, updated_at




Tables for User Metadata


MySQL
Users
user_id, user_name, country


User_Subscription


User_payment_info


Payments




Video Metadata
Thumbnails stored in S3
1 Thumbnail = 10KB
10KB * 100K = 1GB
Replication for 10 regions = 1GB * 10 = 10GB
Cached (LRU) Thumbnails for popular videos = 10KB * 10K = 100MB
Replicated across regions = 100MB * 10 regions = 1GB in RAM


Cassandra
Videos
video_id, pixel, offset, blob_store_url,  status, uploaded_by, thumbnail_url, name, description, created_at, uploaded_at
